# Mu-SE373-Ionic Project

## *Setting Up the Environment*
    I am already working on web development and in the past, I played with ionic framework for a little while.
    So everything was already pretty much set.
    Of course I had to check if everything is up to date.
    For that purpose, I checked node.js , npm and ionic-cli versions. If any of them were out of date, I would update them accordingly.

    After making sure everything is fine, I created a github repository and cloned it.
    Inside the local folder, I initialized the project via ionic-cli and selected react.js as the javascript framework.
    After a little while everything was good to go.
